Chairman's foreword

Welcome to the Workshop on 5G NR IMT2020 evaluation intended to present the details of the 5G NR radio interface as per the 3GPP Release 15 completed standards and the Release 16 planned features. 

3GPP has been working extremely hard to bring 5G NR standards to the industry in an accelerated manner. Non-standalone 5G NR was completed in December 2017, and the corresponding ASN.1 has been stabilized in June/2018. 

Standalone 5G NR was completed in June/2018, and the corresponding ASN.1 scheduled to be frozen in September/2018. 

Some of the architecture options to facilitate migration from LTE to 5G NR will be completed in December/2018 still within Release 15. 

3GPP has also approved the work program for Release 16 containing a host of new and enhanced functionalities for 5G NR. The target completion for Release 16 is December/2019. 3GPP submission to IMT2020 will contain both Release 15 and Release 16 functionality.


`Balazs Bertenyi, Chairman of 3GPP RAN.`
