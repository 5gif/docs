# Background

Following the Recommendation ITU‑R M.2083, which defines the framework and overall objectives of the future development of IMT for 2020 and beyond, WP 5D has completed several key draft new Reports related to the IMT-2020 terrestrial radio interfaces on;

–                 "Minimum requirements related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)" (Document 5/40)

–                 "Guidelines for evaluation of radio interface technologies for IMT-2020" (Document 5/57)

–                 "Requirements, evaluation criteria and submission templates for the development of IMT-2020" (Document 5/56)

–                 Revision 1 of Document IMT-2020/2 on "Submission, evaluation process and consensus building for IMT-2020" (Document IMT-2020/2(Rev.1))

From the 28th meeting of WP 5D in October 2017, the Step 3 of the IMT-2020 developing process "Submission/Reception of the RIT and SRIT proposals and acknowledgement of receipt" will start in accordance with Document IMT-2020/2(Rev.1).

Therefore, in conjunction with the 28th meeting, WP 5D will be holding a workshop on IMT-2020 focussing on the terrestrial radio interfaces.

# Objectives
The objectives of the workshop are as follows;

–                 to promote information sharing on IMT-2020;

–                 to facilitate dialog among ITU-R WP 5D, the possible proponents and the evaluation groups; and in particular

–                 to provide information on the ITU-R WP 5D process for IMT-2020 standardization including minimum technical performance requirements and evaluation guidelines;

–                 to invite possible proponents of IMT-2020 RIT/SRIT to present current and future development aspects about IMT-2020 RITs/SRITs; and

–                 to invite registered independent evaluation groups to present information about their evaluation group and planned actions.
