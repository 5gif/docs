Requirements related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)

·         Report ITU-R M.2410 – (TPR -Technical Performance Requirement of IMT-2020 system)  This Report describes key requirements related to the minimum technical performance of IMT-2020 candidate radio interface technologies. It also provides the necessary background information about the individual requirements and the justification for the items and values chosen. Provision of such background information is needed for a broader understanding of the requirements. This Report is based on the ongoing development activities of external research and technology organizations.

Guidelines for evaluation of radio interface technologies for IMT-2020

 

Report ITU-R M.2412 – (– (Evaluation Methodology of a candidate technology, and Channel model) ) This Report provides guidelines for the procedure, the methodology and the criteria (technical, spectrum and service) to be used in evaluating the candidate IMT-2020 radio interface technologies (RITs) or Set of RITs (SRITs) for a number of test environments. These test environments are chosen to simulate closely the more stringent radio operating environments. The evaluation procedure is designed in such a way that the overall performance of the candidate RITs/SRITs may be fairly and equally assessed on a technical basis. It ensures that the overall IMT 2020 objectives are met.

[Agenda](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-R/study-groups/rsg5/rwp5d/imt-2020/Pages/ws-20171004.aspx)

ITU-R WP5D (Working Party 5D) had organized a workshop to share the information related to ITU-R’s IMT-2020 Technical Requirements, Evaluation Methodology for Independent Evaluation Groups as well as the Proponents of the candidate technology. The workshop had presenters from the IMT-2020 Proponents ( 3GPP, China , Korea & DECT), Independent Evaluation Groups from China, Taiwan etc, and the Technical Work groups on understanding the relevant ITU documents. You can find the documents on the ITU website

## Event 2 : 3GPP Workshop on IMT2020  (Oct 2018) (http://www.3gpp.org/news-events/3gpp-news/1976-imt_2020)

3GPP had submitted its candidate specifications’ self-evaluation reports to ITU-R WP5D in Meeting #31. This workshop was organized by 3GPP to all Independent Evaluation Groups to understand the 3GPP results as well as the features of 3GPP Rel.15 specifications of LTE and NR (New Radio). They also presented what are the new study-items and features being discussed at 3GPP for Rel.16 and beyond.
