## Requirements related to technical performance for IMT-2020 radio interface(s)

### Report ITU-R M.2410 – (TPR -Technical Performance Requirement of IMT-2020 system)  
This Report describes key requirements related to the minimum technical performance of IMT-2020 candidate radio interface technologies. It also provides the necessary background information about the individual requirements and the justification for the items and values chosen. Provision of such background information is needed for a broader understanding of the requirements. This Report is based on the ongoing development activities of external research and technology organizations.

## Guidelines for evaluation of radio interface technologies for IMT-2020

### Report ITU-R M.2412 – (– (Evaluation Methodology of a candidate technology, and Channel model) ) 
This Report provides guidelines for the procedure, the methodology and the criteria (technical, spectrum and service) to be used in evaluating the candidate IMT-2020 radio interface technologies (RITs) or Set of RITs (SRITs) for a number of test environments. These test environments are chosen to simulate closely the more stringent radio operating environments. The evaluation procedure is designed in such a way that the overall performance of the candidate RITs/SRITs may be fairly and equally assessed on a technical basis. It ensures that the overall IMT 2020 objectives are met.
